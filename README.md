<h1 align="left">Project Description</h1>

<p align="left">This project provides a console application designed to analyze the performance of various graph algorithms across different graph representations. The primary focus is on the efficiency of algorithms like Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Kruskal's, and Prim's algorithms when using adjacency lists and incidence matrixes.</p>
